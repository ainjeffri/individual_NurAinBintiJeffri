 I used to work in a boutique after SPM and every semester break. It can be said that I am close to the owner of the boutique and he never tired of greeting me to work in his boutique. The boutique is quite well known in my home area in Penang.

 Many memories I have had and one of them is serving the people around, For example, each customer has its own reasons. But most of the customers I receive are all just kind, very understanding and friendly. Usually, our relationship between customers will not stop after the work is over, in fact we are all so close that we will all meet and always say hello.
 What I can conclude is that I am very fortunate to work here because I am surrounded by good people and always appreciate my presence. I am so thankful to be surrounded by them all. In life, we must be kind to everyone without expecting anything in return.Being courteous is more important than being correct. Often, what people require is not a smart intellect that talks, but rather a particular heart that listens. So, let's be nice to one another:)
